# Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors Analysis



# Project Overview
This project analyzes cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among hospital patients in Bangladesh using the **CAIR-CVD-2025** dataset (n = 1,026). The goal was to identify how biological and behavioral factors relate to cardiovascular risk scores and risk levels in a low- and middle-income country (LMIC) clinical setting.




# Data & Methods
- Data source: Hospital-based cross-sectional dataset (Bangladesh)
- Key variables: Systolic blood pressure, BMI, total cholesterol, diabetes status, smoking status, age, sex
- Data cleaning: Recalculated BMI from height/weight, resolved blood pressure inconsistencies, validated clinical categories
- statistical analysis: 
  - Pearson correlation & linear regression  
  - Independent t-tests & ANOVA  
  - Chi-square tests for categorical associations
- Tools: R (tidyverse, ggplot2)



# Visualizations & Analysis
- Blood pressure category distribution (pie chart)
- CVD risk score comparisons by diabetes and smoking status (density plots)
- Associations between risk score and cholesterol, BP, BMI, and age (regression plots)
- Risk level stratification by BMI, BP, cholesterol, age, sex, and smoking
- Sex-stratified interaction analysis (BMI × sex)



# Key Findings
- Blood pressure and diabetes were the strongest drivers of cardiovascular risk
- Higher cholesterol and BMI were significantly associated with higher CVD risk scores
- Smoking status was not significantly associated with risk score in this hospital sample
- Age and sex did not independently predict risk score after adjustment



# Skills Demonstrated
- Public health data analysis & interpretation  
- Clinical data cleaning and validation  
- Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing  
- High-quality health data visualization  
- Reproducible analysis in R
